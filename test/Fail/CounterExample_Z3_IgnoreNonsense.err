Found counter-example:
  x = + 1
refuting + 1 ≡ + 0
Some assumptions could not be encoded; they may invalidate counterexamples:
_ : Agda.Builtin.List.List {Agda.Primitive.lzero} Agda.Builtin.Int.Int --- Unrecognized identifier Agda.Builtin.List.List

when checking that the expression unquote solveZ3 has type
(x : ℤ) → List ℤ → x ≡ + 0
